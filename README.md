# Deep Learning Challenge Analysis Report

# Overview of Analysis:
The purpose of this project was to develop a deep learning model which predicts the success of orgainzations funded by Alphabet Soup. The model classified if an organization would be successful based on various features from the dataset. The analysis included data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and optimization to enhance predicative accuracy.

# Results
- The target variable for this model is IS_SUCCESSFUL, which indicates whether an organization was successful.
- Feature Variable(s):
-- The features used to predict the success include variables such as:
-- APPLICATION_TYPE
-- AFFILIATION
-- CLASSIFICATION
-- USE_CASE
-- ORGANIZATION
-- STATUS
-- INCOME_AMT
-- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
-- ASK_AMT
